# Breast_Cancer_Prediction

## About 
A machine learning project done to predict if a given case of breast cancer is benign or malignant based on features like area, perimeter, texture, etc. 

## Steps Involved
1. Problem Definition (Breast Cancer data).
2. Loading the Dataset.
3. Analyze Data (same scale but different distributions of data).
    * Evaluate Algorithms (KNN looked good).
    * Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization (KNN and SVM looked good).
4. Algorithm Tuning (K=19 for KNN was good, SVM with an RBF kernel and C=100 was best) 
5. Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset)
